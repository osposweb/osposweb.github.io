## General Printing Support

Currently OSPOS can print in any environment, you can use a installed printer. The only limitation is with Fiscal KIT's due to the fact that it needs AD-HOC special dependent on each country requirements.

## Device Printing Support

A priter could be the Star TSP 100 ECO using the Firefox or Chrome browsers. A label printer could be the Zebra LP 2824 Plus printer with 2 x 1 labels. 
Other customers have had success with other printers from companies. If you plan to purchase a different receipt printer, try to get one that prints on paper that is 72 mm or greater.

Obviously printing depends on the browser, so it must be first configured and then in ospos 
the printing configuration has some options, only enable with some changes over the browser.
For the Zebra it's recommended also search at https://www.peninsula-group.com/mac-thermal-printer-driver/ 
the CUPS interface for Unixes comes with basic enough support that works as its.

## Barcode Printing

This feature don't need special settings, of course a printer must be corrrectly configured, continue reading for that. For how to print after, refers to the [DOCS USERS Getting Started: Inventory](DOCS-USERS-Getting-Started-usage#3-inventory) wiki page section.

But remenber as we previously mentioned, Our recommended label printer is the Zebra LP 2824 Plus printer with 2 x 1 labels. Other customers have had success with other printers from companies.


# How to printing

Either for normal printing or for devices/receipt printing, first need OS configuration/installation printer, then browser configuration and lasted go to **Office->StoreConfig->Receipt**, here the most important settings are *Format* and *Font size*.

![printing settings:](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10962177/36354930-c33ea10c-1498-11e8-8b0b-a4eb2b2ecbdb.png)

* **Format** defines amount of information to the receipt will be printed. Reduced can be help with some printing settings.
* **FontSize** defines size of the font this must be set in correct size number depending of the output of the printing.

Then the **default receipt shows more info than the short (order)** receipt. So **for printing in 78mm printers and related, must use "order" as format**.

The **Autoprinting** are explained here in below specific section.

Unless margings and show dialog printing rest of the options are self explanatory, please read section below for.

### Firefox, Palemoon, Icecat

AutoPrinting support also advanced feature are enabled in two ways, the first using the jsPrint addon at
https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/js-print-setup The supported browsers must be **firefox << 49.9**, **Palemoon >> 24**, and **Icedcat >> 16**. The second way its preconfiguring the browser to printing directly.

Enable jsprint/seamlessprint settings in Firefox, must configure with enable for all the sites (low security, sorry). In some cases newer firefox can try https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/seamless-print/ but not Quamtun Firefox.

After enabling/configure this addon, the ospos print settings will be available and can be configured.

Go to Store config and reselect the printers, occasionally had to select a different printer. Submit. 
Then go back and select the correct printer. Then submit.

**Alternate second way for newer browsers**: Type about:config at Firefox’s/Palemoon's location bar and hit Enter. Right click at anywhere on the page and select New > Boolean.  Enter the preference name as print.always_print_silent and click OK. Then set the boolean value to true. Restart firefox. This need that the default OS printer must be the desired receipt printer.

### Chrome

Not recommended, but receipt auto printing is also available in Chrome by using kiosk mode. A printer 
should be selected once after launching Chrome using a custom shortcut.

A new icon application launcher or launch/invoke the binary adding the `--kiosk --kiosk-printing ` option 
to the executable. By the way, to make the kiosk mode effecting you need to close all the chrome 
apps and restart otherwise it doesn't work. Open a Terminal, and write the command: `google-chrome --kiosk --kiosk-printing `

After enabling/configure kiosk, the ospos print settings will be available and can be configured.

Go to Store config and reselect the printers, occasionally had to select a different printer. Submit. 
Then go back and select the correct printer. Then submit.

## Fiscal printing

Some countries need some special communications with internal chip in the printers, this feature are 
only done locally and its not possible unless a specific ad-hoc can be done or with special device that 
receive the raw printing and send from the browser to the printer.

You can ask here for some services by few bucks, adaptations are made easy for some countries. Open an issue [a support ticket Issue (by click here)](https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/issues/new) just few words ahead to your solution!
